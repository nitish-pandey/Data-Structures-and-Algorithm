# Given an array of N integers arr[] where each element represents the max length of the jump that 
# can be made forward from that element. Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array 
# (starting from the first element). If an element is 0, then you cannot move through that element.

# Input:
# N = 11 
# arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9} 
# Output: 3 

# Input :
# N = 6
# arr = {1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7}
# Output: 2
